# Simple Notepad Clone
This repository contains the source code for a simple Notepad clone developed as a part of WinForms tutorial classes I was conducting as a part of the [Programming in Graphical Environment course](https://pages.mini.pw.edu.pl/~aszklarp/pige.php?lang=en) at the [WUT MiNI](https://ww2.mini.pw.edu.pl/). The application was created during 90-minute lab sessions with my students to demonstrate the basics of Windows Forms application development in C#. This project serves as an educational tool and a starting point for students to explore GUI application development on the Windows platform using [Windows Forms .NET UI framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/overview/).

**This app is not fully finished!**

### Features
The Notepad clone includes essential features such as:
- Creating new documents
- Opening existing documents
- Saving documents
- Basic text editing functionalities (cut, copy, paste, undo, redo) - still need to be finished!
- Font settings

### TODOs and potential feature ideas
I recommend finishing this app at home as a preparation for graded classes. \
Here is a list of potential features you can add or at least think of how to implement them:
 - Finish all basic Notepad functionality such as: basic text search/replace, printing documents
 - Support for different text encodings
 - Words statistics
 - Custom control for text rendering
 - Regex text search and replace
 - Comparing the content of two files
 - Simple spell-checking functionality and auto-completion
 - Advanced text operations such as: line sorting, line trimming, etc.
 - Multiline text selection and editing
 - Syntax highlighting
 - Markdown preview
 - System of plugins
